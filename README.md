**Project Overview**  
This project was developed to meet FreeCodeCampâ€™s requirements for creating a technical documentation page, focusing on strategies for building a portfolio targeted at developers.

----------

**Features**

-   **Responsive Design**: The page adapts to different devices, including desktops and mobile devices.
-   **Fixed Navigation**: A fixed navigation bar on the left side (or top on mobile devices) allows easy navigation between sections.
-   **Eight Content Sections**:

    -   Planning Projects
    -   Tracking Progress
    -   Publishing and Organizing
    -   Optimizing Profiles
    -   Maintaining the Portfolio
-   **JavaScript Code Examples**: Each section contains code snippets relevant to portfolio-building topics.

----------

**Technologies Used**

1.  **Clone the Repository**  
    Clone the repository to your local environment using the command:  
    
    `git clone https://github.com/lukasrozado/portfolio-documentation-page.git` 
    
2.  **Open the Project**  
    Navigate to the project folder and open the `index.html` file in your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text).
    
3.  **Open in Browser**

**Code Example**  
Example of a JavaScript snippet used in the "Setting Goals" section to define portfolio goals, including career field and skills to showcase:


`const portfolioGoals = {
  career: "Front-End Developer",
  targetAudience: "Hiring Managers and Recruiters",
  skillsToShowcase: ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "React"]
};
console.log(portfolioGoals);` 

This code helps organize goals for your portfolio in a structured way, guiding the selection of projects and certifications.
